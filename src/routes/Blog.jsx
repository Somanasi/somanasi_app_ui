    Blog Title: [insert blog title]
    Mini Description: [insert brief teaser for the blog post, highlighting the topic or main idea]
    Similar to the first blog post, this blog post should be displayed as a clickable link, with a brief teaser included to entice the reader to click and read the full post

    Personally I'd prefer the blogs be about teachers and developers, maybe the founding team but not a must
