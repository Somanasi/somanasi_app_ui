    <div>ADD CONTENT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE ON BLOGS LIST PAGE. DESCRIBE BRIEFLY HOW EACH BLOG SHOULD LOOK LIKE IN THE LIST AND ADD CONTENT FOR MINI DESCRIPTION
    Blog Title: [insert blog title]
    Mini Description: [insert brief teaser for the blog post, highlighting the topic or main idea]
    The blog post should be displayed as a clickable link, with the blog title serving as the anchor text. When the link is clicked, the reader should be taken to the full blog post.
    
    Personally I'd prefer the blogs be about teachers and developers, maybe the founding team but not a must
